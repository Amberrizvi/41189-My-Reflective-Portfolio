#41189 Reflective Portfolio
#Week 1

###What have I learnt this week that I did not know before? 
My knowledge of human-centred complex systems prior to the first workshop was extremely limited and was largely reduced to confusion over the beginning terms ‘human-centred complex’. As I have very little understanding of information systems overall, being in my first year, I had thought the term referred to a specific and highly specialised part of the subject. I now realise the term rather encompasses a broad and unlimited range of interrelated parts, not particularly pertaining to the technology industry but rather to every individual. 

###What insights have I gained?
While introductory lectures are often perceived as unnecessary or general information, the outline of module one during this lecture provided a holistic and nuanced understanding of the overall subject through simply defining its name. Through insight provided this week, I have learnt how these complex systems prevail over every aspect of life. I have used the diagram below to visually outline my understanding of how these human centred complex systems react and interweave. 


















###What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses I have observed?
I believe a personal challenge moving forward may be the ability to focus on just one of these systems at a time, or try to assume their independence of the sake of modelling. A strength I have observed would be the ability to quickly take on board such a broad and complex topic following the first lecture. 

###What can I do next time and with what anticipated results?
After completing the post-work for the lecture, I had realised the connections between system modelling and the mathematical basis in statistics. This was prompted through the creation of a relatively simple math equation from the ‘Standing Ovation’ model in the textbook, provoking me to find the points of connection between the information systems and business sides of my degree. Reflecting on this, I hope to find more points of convergence and divergence between the two different parts of my double degree to hopefully gain the most I can from my learning. I believe that learning the basics of Python for use in this subject will assist in this process and be a point of interest, specifically in the case of my statistics subject, and I hope I can use this to elevate my learning in the future.
