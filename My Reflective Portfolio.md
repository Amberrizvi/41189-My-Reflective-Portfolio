# 41189 Reflective Portfolio
# Week 1

### What have I learnt this week that I did not know before? 
My knowledge of human-centred complex systems prior to the first workshop was extremely limited and was largely reduced to confusion over the beginning terms ‘human-centred complex’. As I have very little understanding of information systems overall, being in my first year, I had thought the term referred to a specific and highly specialised part of the subject. I now realise the term rather encompasses a broad and unlimited range of interrelated parts, not particularly pertaining to the technology industry but rather to every individual. 

### What insights have I gained?
While introductory lectures are often perceived as unnecessary or general information, the outline of module one during this lecture provided a holistic and nuanced understanding of the overall subject through simply defining its name. Through insight provided this week, I have learnt how these complex systems prevail over every aspect of life. 

### What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses I have observed?
I believe a personal challenge moving forward may be the ability to focus on just one of these systems at a time, or try to assume their independence of the sake of modelling. A strength I have observed would be the ability to quickly take on board such a broad and complex topic following the first lecture. 

### What can I do next time and with what anticipated results?
After completing the post-work for the lecture, I had realised the connections between system modelling and the mathematical basis in statistics. This was prompted through the creation of a relatively simple math equation from the ‘Standing Ovation’ model in the textbook, provoking me to find the points of connection between the information systems and business sides of my degree. Reflecting on this, I hope to find more points of convergence and divergence between the two different parts of my double degree to hopefully gain the most I can from my learning. I believe that learning the basics of Python for use in this subject will assist in this process and be a point of interest, specifically in the case of my statistics subject, and I hope I can use this to elevate my learning in the future. 

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week, I have learnt the benefits of adopting a many-model mindset and why models are implemented. While we were presented the idea of ‘group think’ as a counter argument to the ‘wisdom of crowds’ idea, I had not previously learnt or known of the latter. As a result, I now understand both the merit and the possible detriment of drawing conclusions, making decisions and researching in group work, which I will now consider during the assignment. 

### What insights have I gained?
From this week’s lecture, I have gained insight into the benefit of many models and the consequences of single models. Previously, I had not considered how utilising one model can be damaging, as I had taken the perspective that one model is better than none. However, understanding the limiting nature of this perspective has resulted in a step toward understanding and utilising many-model thinking regularly. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
From reading about some of the models mentioned in the module two post-lecture work, such as the prisoners dilemma model, I think a weakness I will encounter when learning new models for the assignment will be trying to simplify them and then apply them to other situations. As it took thorough research for me to fully understand the prisoner’s dilemma model, I also gathered its complexities and amendments to grasp how the model can suggest the most likely and the most beneficial outcomes. However, upon reflection I fail to understand how those nuances in the model can then be applied to cooperation scenarios other than that of the ‘prisoner’s dilemma’.  Despite this, I believe that gaining a greater understanding about other broad models can assist to solve this issue, as it is likely this will allow me to diversify my thinking process. Through researching this specific model, a strength I believe will assist me in ironing out the issue mentioned above is my own personal interest in understanding these models. As I am genuinely engaged in the content from this subject, I anticipate it will drive me to learn more about these models and use them to their full capacity.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I manage them?
Challenges I have encountered this week involve understanding the best method of learning for myself. While trying to learn about a handful of different models, absorbing that information on face value hasn’t necessarily been useful in retaining knowledge. As the purpose of learning about the models is ultimately to find some that may be applicable for the problem I will select in the assignment, a learning method to consider as the semester continues is a brief list of notes of models with their explanation and key features to refer back to.

## Week 3: 

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week I have learnt how modelling people and their thinking processes is computed and which strategies are used to estimate them. Prior to this lesson, I had perceived modelling the complexities of people to be something that is out of reach and too difficult to complete successfully. In addition, this lesson demonstrated modelling I have already done in the past, specifically, I did not realise all of the basic theories and equations in economics I had learnt in high school were effectively modelling behavioural patterns of individuals in society. I now know these were largely rational models. 

### What insights have I gained?
As I had predicted during the first week, this subject crosses over significantly with my business Statistics subject. This week, the lecture discussed how decision trees can be used to model the process of choosing between alternatives. This ties in with binomial theory and probability trees I had done last week in Statistics. Hopefully, in coming weeks, I am able to apply this understanding of practical mathematics and probability to model the problem my group will chose for the assignment. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths that I have observed?
After these first three weeks, a strength I have observed is my ability to make connections between content in this subject and other subjects or information I have learnt previously. I think this strength will be useful beyond this semester at university, and something I will be able to extend about in my career. I hope honing this skill will increase the transferability of general skills and knowledge across future jobs 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Last week I had noted it was challenging trying to understand the ability to transfer models across disciplines to solve different problems using the same principles. Following this week’s lecture, I believe I now have a better grasp on this idea, as I see that many of the models we have seen as of yet do not necessarily pertain to industries, for example, engineering, marketing and so on, but rather to holistic problems and ideas such as  signalling and decision making. I think engaging during the lecture through using my microphone in Zoom assisted in this specific learning process, and I anticipate it will continue to be useful to verbally interact with the class to aid my understanding of content and to have a better class experience. As a result, in coming lectures I will seek to be more active during the workshops. 

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week I considered to be quite content heavy and as a result I learned a lot. One of the first realisations was the ability to boil down significant problems into main ‘categories’, being feedbacks, time delays and nonlinearities. I believe this aspect of the content was a fundamental point of learning as understanding what a problem is caused by outlines which models and strategies can be used in conjunction to solve it. I hope this will become useful not only in the initial stages of the assignment to come, in establishing which issue to pick, but also later as I encounter problems in my career. Another thing I have learnt from the workshop this week is the commonality of modelling. While the purpose and merits of modelling complex systems has been clearly demonstrated in previous lectures, the prevalence of their use, such as when looking at networks or understanding the projections of COVID-19, I did not previously consider. Through this, I now understand how often modelling is and can be used on a regular basis for a varying range of issues. 

### What insights have I gained?
The video which demonstrated how simple rules can guide Agent-Based Models (‘hide and seek’ game) provided a range of insights to my learning this week. I believe this demonstration highlighted how truly intelligent theses modelling systems can be. The video format was highly beneficial in understanding this process as it visualised and animated a concept which previously seemed quite complex and static. As a result of this realisation, I hope to use and research more videos to fill gaps in my knowledge and to gain a greater understanding in weeks to come.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
As there was a lot of content to dissolve this week, a perceived weakness of mine is the ability to take on knowledge as the workshops continue. A possible strategy to ensure the information is being retained is using the break times to create mind maps consolidating the previous topic. Despite this, a potential strength I have observed is now knowing which learning styles now work best for me. From the videos this week, I believe multi-media aids in my learning process and I will now consider note-taking and reviewing content in a range of different visual, verbal and written methods. 

## Week 5:

### What have I learnt this week?
As stated in the lecture, this week’s topic of aggregating decisions and behaviour rooted the real-world capabilities of calculating statistical models I am encountering in other subjects. Coincidentally, this week in statistics I had learnt about sampling and sampling distributions. The video in this weeks lecture, about the central limit theorem, solidified my understanding of normal distributions and the pattern of their samples, assisting me with my homework below (namely, part 3). While I anticipate that having a greater knowledge about these specific models will hopefully benefit me and my group later as we investigate models to choose for the problem, I believe I may further complicate and confuse the application of the models. As a result, a solution to this may be looking into probability distributions that I know less of the mathematics behind, such as long tail distributions or linear models, in order for me to simplify calculations while also learning more about a wider range of models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The commonality and usefulness of understanding long tail distributions was something I had previously not considered. While companies like Ali Baba and Amazon have reaped the benefits of using these distributions, the negative implications on equity is a significant, specifically on wealth and income distributions, and how this may affect different groups of people. Personally, I would be interested in investigating long-tail distributions further and will consider this when making decisions with my group for the assignment. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths that I have observed?
Building off last week’s idea that video content may be an effective way to learn and get a grasp of new models, I had found a few YouTube clips to explain linear models where my understanding fell short. I believe this strength of seeking independent information to fill voids in my knowledge will be useful as the semester continues and I hope to continue to do this.
