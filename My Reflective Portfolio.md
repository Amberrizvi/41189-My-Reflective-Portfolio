# 41189 Reflective Portfolio
# Week 1

### What have I learnt this week that I did not know before? 
My knowledge of human-centred complex systems prior to the first workshop was extremely limited and was largely reduced to confusion over the beginning terms ‘human-centred complex’. As I have very little understanding of information systems overall, being in my first year, I had thought the term referred to a specific and highly specialised part of the subject. I now realise the term rather encompasses a broad and unlimited range of interrelated parts, not particularly pertaining to the technology industry but rather to every individual. 

### What insights have I gained?
While introductory lectures are often perceived as unnecessary or general information, the outline of module one during this lecture provided a holistic and nuanced understanding of the overall subject through simply defining its name. Through insight provided this week, I have learnt how these complex systems prevail over every aspect of life. 

### What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses I have observed?
I believe a personal challenge moving forward may be the ability to focus on just one of these systems at a time, or try to assume their independence of the sake of modelling. A strength I have observed would be the ability to quickly take on board such a broad and complex topic following the first lecture. 

### What can I do next time and with what anticipated results?
After completing the post-work for the lecture, I had realised the connections between system modelling and the mathematical basis in statistics. This was prompted through the creation of a relatively simple math equation from the ‘Standing Ovation’ model in the textbook, provoking me to find the points of connection between the information systems and business sides of my degree. Reflecting on this, I hope to find more points of convergence and divergence between the two different parts of my double degree to hopefully gain the most I can from my learning. I believe that learning the basics of Python for use in this subject will assist in this process and be a point of interest, specifically in the case of my statistics subject, and I hope I can use this to elevate my learning in the future. 

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week, I have learnt the benefits of adopting a many-model mindset and why models are implemented. While we were presented the idea of ‘group think’ as a counter argument to the ‘wisdom of crowds’ idea, I had not previously learnt or known of the latter. As a result, I now understand both the merit and the possible detriment of drawing conclusions, making decisions and researching in group work, which I will now consider during the assignment. 

### What insights have I gained?
From this week’s lecture, I have gained insight into the benefit of many models and the consequences of single models. Previously, I had not considered how utilising one model can be damaging, as I had taken the perspective that one model is better than none. However, understanding the limiting nature of this perspective has resulted in a step toward understanding and utilising many-model thinking regularly. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
From reading about some of the models mentioned in the module two post-lecture work, such as the prisoners dilemma model, I think a weakness I will encounter when learning new models for the assignment will be trying to simplify them and then apply them to other situations. As it took thorough research for me to fully understand the prisoner’s dilemma model, I also gathered its complexities and amendments to grasp how the model can suggest the most likely and the most beneficial outcomes. However, upon reflection I fail to understand how those nuances in the model can then be applied to cooperation scenarios other than that of the ‘prisoner’s dilemma’.  Despite this, I believe that gaining a greater understanding about other broad models can assist to solve this issue, as it is likely this will allow me to diversify my thinking process. Through researching this specific model, a strength I believe will assist me in ironing out the issue mentioned above is my own personal interest in understanding these models. As I am genuinely engaged in the content from this subject, I anticipate it will drive me to learn more about these models and use them to their full capacity.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I manage them?
Challenges I have encountered this week involve understanding the best method of learning for myself. While trying to learn about a handful of different models, absorbing that information on face value hasn’t necessarily been useful in retaining knowledge. As the purpose of learning about the models is ultimately to find some that may be applicable for the problem I will select in the assignment, a learning method to consider as the semester continues is a brief list of notes of models with their explanation and key features to refer back to.

##Week 3: 

###What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week I have learnt how modelling people and their thinking processes is computed and which strategies are used to estimate them. Prior to this lesson, I had perceived modelling the complexities of people to be something that is out of reach and too difficult to complete successfully. In addition, this lesson demonstrated modelling I have already done in the past, specifically, I did not realise all of the basic theories and equations in economics I had learnt in high school were effectively modelling behavioural patterns of individuals in society. I now know these were largely rational models. 

###What insights have I gained?
As I had predicted during the first week, this subject crosses over significantly with my business Statistics subject. This week, the lecture discussed how decision trees can be used to model the process of choosing between alternatives. This ties in with binomial theory and probability trees I had done last week in Statistics. Hopefully, in coming weeks, I am able to apply this understanding of practical mathematics and probability to model the problem my group will chose for the assignment. 

###What are (my/the) perceived strengths that I have observed?
After these first three weeks, a strength I have observed is my ability to make connections between content in this subject and other subjects or information I have learnt previously. I think this strength will be useful beyond this semester at university, and something I will be able to extend about in my career. I hope honing this skill will increase the transferability of general skills and knowledge across future jobs 

###What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Last week I had noted it was challenging trying to understand the ability to transfer models across disciplines to solve different problems using the same principles. Following this week’s lecture, I believe I now have a better grasp on this idea, as I see that many of the models we have seen as of yet do not necessarily pertain to industries, for example, engineering, marketing and so on, but rather to holistic problems and ideas such as  signalling and decision making. I think engaging during the lecture through using my microphone in Zoom assisted in this specific learning process, and I anticipate it will continue to be useful to verbally interact with the class to aid my understanding of content and to have a better class experience. As a result, in coming lectures I will seek to be more active during the workshops.
