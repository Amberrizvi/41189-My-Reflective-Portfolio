# 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 1

testing

### What have I learnt this week that I did not know before? 
My knowledge of human-centred complex systems prior to the first workshop was extremely limited and was largely reduced to confusion over the beginning terms ‘human-centred complex’. As I have very little understanding of information systems overall, being in my first year, I had thought the term referred to a specific and highly specialised part of the subject. I now realise the term rather encompasses a broad and unlimited range of interrelated parts, not particularly pertaining to the technology industry but rather to every individual. 

### What insights have I gained?
While introductory lectures are often perceived as unnecessary or general information, the outline of module one during this lecture provided a holistic and nuanced understanding of the overall subject through simply defining its name. Through insight provided this week, I have learnt how these complex systems prevail over every aspect of life. 

### What are my perceived strengths and weaknesses I have observed?
I believe a personal challenge moving forward may be the ability to focus on just one of these systems at a time, or try to assume their independence of the sake of modelling. A strength I have observed would be the ability to quickly take on board such a broad and complex topic following the first lecture. 

### What can I do next time and with what anticipated results?
After completing the post-work for the lecture, I had realised the connections between system modelling and the mathematical basis in statistics. This was prompted through the creation of a relatively simple math equation from the ‘Standing Ovation’ model in the textbook, provoking me to find the points of connection between the information systems and business sides of my degree. Reflecting on this, I hope to find more points of convergence and divergence between the two different parts of my double degree to hopefully gain the most I can from my learning. I believe that learning the basics of Python for use in this subject will assist in this process and be a point of interest, specifically in the case of my statistics subject, and I hope I can use this to elevate my learning in the future. 

## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week, I have learnt the benefits of adopting a many-model mindset and why models are implemented. While we were presented the idea of ‘group think’ as a counter argument to the ‘wisdom of crowds’ idea, I had not previously learnt or known of the latter. As a result, I now understand both the merit and the possible detriment of drawing conclusions, making decisions and researching in group work, which I will now consider during the assignment. 

### What insights have I gained?
From this week’s lecture, I have gained insight into the benefit of many models and the consequences of single models. Previously, I had not considered how utilising one model can be damaging, as I had taken the perspective that one model is better than none. However, understanding the limiting nature of this perspective has resulted in a step toward understanding and utilising many-model thinking regularly. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
From reading about some of the models mentioned in the module two post-lecture work, such as the prisoners dilemma model, I think a weakness I will encounter when learning new models for the assignment will be trying to simplify them and then apply them to other situations. As it took thorough research for me to fully understand the prisoner’s dilemma model, I also gathered its complexities and amendments to grasp how the model can suggest the most likely and the most beneficial outcomes. However, upon reflection I fail to understand how those nuances in the model can then be applied to cooperation scenarios other than that of the ‘prisoner’s dilemma’.  Despite this, I believe that gaining a greater understanding about other broad models can assist to solve this issue, as it is likely this will allow me to diversify my thinking process. Through researching this specific model, a strength I believe will assist me in ironing out the issue mentioned above is my own personal interest in understanding these models. As I am genuinely engaged in the content from this subject, I anticipate it will drive me to learn more about these models and use them to their full capacity.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well did I manage them?
Challenges I have encountered this week involve understanding the best method of learning for myself. While trying to learn about a handful of different models, absorbing that information on face value hasn’t necessarily been useful in retaining knowledge. As the purpose of learning about the models is ultimately to find some that may be applicable for the problem I will select in the assignment, a learning method to consider as the semester continues is a brief list of notes of models with their explanation and key features to refer back to.

## Week 3: 

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week I have learnt how modelling people and their thinking processes is computed and which strategies are used to estimate them. Prior to this lesson, I had perceived modelling the complexities of people to be something that is out of reach and too difficult to complete successfully. In addition, this lesson demonstrated modelling I have already done in the past, specifically, I did not realise all of the basic theories and equations in economics I had learnt in high school were effectively modelling behavioural patterns of individuals in society. I now know these were largely rational models. 

### What insights have I gained?
As I had predicted during the first week, this subject crosses over significantly with my business Statistics subject. This week, the lecture discussed how decision trees can be used to model the process of choosing between alternatives. This ties in with binomial theory and probability trees I had done last week in Statistics. Hopefully, in coming weeks, I am able to apply this understanding of practical mathematics and probability to model the problem my group will chose for the assignment. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths that I have observed?
After these first three weeks, a strength I have observed is my ability to make connections between content in this subject and other subjects or information I have learnt previously. I think this strength will be useful beyond this semester at university, and something I will be able to extend about in my career. I hope honing this skill will increase the transferability of general skills and knowledge across future jobs 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Last week I had noted it was challenging trying to understand the ability to transfer models across disciplines to solve different problems using the same principles. Following this week’s lecture, I believe I now have a better grasp on this idea, as I see that many of the models we have seen as of yet do not necessarily pertain to industries, for example, engineering, marketing and so on, but rather to holistic problems and ideas such as  signalling and decision making. I think engaging during the lecture through using my microphone in Zoom assisted in this specific learning process, and I anticipate it will continue to be useful to verbally interact with the class to aid my understanding of content and to have a better class experience. As a result, in coming lectures I will seek to be more active during the workshops. 

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week? What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week I considered to be quite content heavy and as a result I learned a lot. One of the first realisations was the ability to boil down significant problems into main ‘categories’, being feedbacks, time delays and nonlinearities. I believe this aspect of the content was a fundamental point of learning as understanding what a problem is caused by outlines which models and strategies can be used in conjunction to solve it. I hope this will become useful not only in the initial stages of the assignment to come, in establishing which issue to pick, but also later as I encounter problems in my career. Another thing I have learnt from the workshop this week is the commonality of modelling. While the purpose and merits of modelling complex systems has been clearly demonstrated in previous lectures, the prevalence of their use, such as when looking at networks or understanding the projections of COVID-19, I did not previously consider. Through this, I now understand how often modelling is and can be used on a regular basis for a varying range of issues. 

### What insights have I gained?
The video which demonstrated how simple rules can guide Agent-Based Models (‘hide and seek’ game) provided a range of insights to my learning this week. I believe this demonstration highlighted how truly intelligent theses modelling systems can be. The video format was highly beneficial in understanding this process as it visualised and animated a concept which previously seemed quite complex and static. As a result of this realisation, I hope to use and research more videos to fill gaps in my knowledge and to gain a greater understanding in weeks to come.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
As there was a lot of content to dissolve this week, a perceived weakness of mine is the ability to take on knowledge as the workshops continue. A possible strategy to ensure the information is being retained is using the break times to create mind maps consolidating the previous topic. Despite this, a potential strength I have observed is now knowing which learning styles now work best for me. From the videos this week, I believe multi-media aids in my learning process and I will now consider note-taking and reviewing content in a range of different visual, verbal and written methods. 

## Week 5:

### What have I learnt this week?
As stated in the lecture, this week’s topic of aggregating decisions and behaviour rooted the real-world capabilities of calculating statistical models I am encountering in other subjects. Coincidentally, this week in statistics I had learnt about sampling and sampling distributions. The video in this weeks lecture, about the central limit theorem, solidified my understanding of normal distributions and the pattern of their samples, assisting me with my homework below (namely, part 3). While I anticipate that having a greater knowledge about these specific models will hopefully benefit me and my group later as we investigate models to choose for the problem, I believe I may further complicate and confuse the application of the models. As a result, a solution to this may be looking into probability distributions that I know less of the mathematics behind, such as long tail distributions or linear models, in order for me to simplify calculations while also learning more about a wider range of models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The commonality and usefulness of understanding long tail distributions was something I had previously not considered. While companies like Ali Baba and Amazon have reaped the benefits of using these distributions, the negative implications on equity is a significant, specifically on wealth and income distributions, and how this may affect different groups of people. Personally, I would be interested in investigating long-tail distributions further and will consider this when making decisions with my group for the assignment. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths that I have observed?
Building off last week’s idea that video content may be an effective way to learn and get a grasp of new models, I had found a few YouTube clips to explain linear models where my understanding fell short. I believe this strength of seeking independent information to fill voids in my knowledge will be useful as the semester continues and I hope to continue to do this. 


## Week 6:

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
From this weeks lecture, I believe I have a greater understanding of the universality of some of the models we have learnt so far. The Markov Processes and Random Walks models specifically highlighted this, as they can be applied to predict and study probability in stock markets, sports, computers and how they navigate search engines, and more. Further than that, reading the self-study section on Path Dependence can truly be applicable to all aspects of life. I believe it pertains to the philosophical question; to what extent do we and the actions we take lead our life, or rather, is it randomised and due to luck? Personally, I can see my life as completely dependent on the path of actions and decisions of my parents, their parents, and so on. While it is easy to think of events as independent, taking the economy and how it performs as a more concentrated example demonstrates how the interest earned and there the net sum in my bank account is a reflection of events and actions that have impacted the wider economy.

### What insights have I gained?
From now having a grasp on universal these models can be, I believe I have gained a better insight into how they can be applied to a wide and niche range of problems. I think this lecture presented a few more concrete yet simple examples of how the models are implemented to in real life than previous lectures, and I credit this has greatly aided my learning. I now see, for example, how the Riot model is applicable to the AirBnB business model. I hope this understanding can be transferred as my group begins to work on finding models for the problem we will chose in coming weeks.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
This week, my team has found it difficult to pick a topic for the assignment. While there are a number of interesting topic ideas, the main challenge involved the ability to find one that we are able relate to the best possible models to in order to have a report that holds substance. I believe transparent and honest communication was useful in overcoming this challenge and making the most out of our combined brainstorming. 

 
## Week 7:

### What insights have I gained?

This week’s lecture and post-work gave me new insights into how I view individuals and how they react in the context of a larger crowd. A specific idea that stood out to me was the suggestion that ‘micro-motives do not equal macro-behaviour’, as it takes into account the cumulative impact of communities. Instances that would be interesting to apply this theory to and segregation models to to would be political elections, especially in two-party systems, and how ‘micro-motives’ can change the overall outcomes. In addition, it would be interesting to apply coordination games and standing ovation models to investigate the impact of subsidies compared to tariffs, and to track the history and future progress of ‘trade wars’ between the US and China and how this has incentivised or discouraged other countries’ foreign trade policies. This could possibly be another avenue to investigate for the upcoming the group assignment.
This week’s models and their comments on culture as possibly a coordination game is something that I have thought may link to a book I am currently reading called Sapiens. The book details the history of homo-sapiens, and it would be fascinating to find the moment coordination occurred and which conditions fostered the creation of different cultures. While this may be out of depth for the model and for myself, I am curious if any other research has been done to investigate this, and I hope to look into it in future. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and challenges that I have observed?

Though I have detailed this previously, I think a strength that I still uphold is curiosity and interest into these models and their applications. As stated in another week’s entry, it does motivate and challenge me to stay engaged in the subject and has been a useful strength as I begin to research for the assignment. 
Something I anticipate will continue to be difficult in a group setting is making decisions. The challenges of an online environment and group meetings does make any form of communication slightly more difficult, and I foresee it may be hard making group decisions over Zoom and messages. Despite this, it is a learned skill and I hope as my group becomes more familiar this will improve with time.

## Week 8:

### What have I learnt this week?
This week’s workshop outlined models which were probably some of the most versatile we have studied so far. Specifically in the Colonel Blotto game, I believe where this is applicable in my own life most significantly is in the context of job and scholarship applications. The game puts some sense behind the idea that it may not be the most qualified person hired or chosen, but rather those with ‘tricks’. These tricks might translate to be interpersonal skills, confidence, or even networking connections. As my group has chosen the topic of gender inequality following the pandemic, viewing women’s employment under the lens of the Blotto game also brings new insights. In researching, I had found that many women will not apply to specific jobs, in this circumstance, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, because they did not meet one or two of the requirements listed. In contrast, the men who do apply for the same jobs often do not meet all of the requirements, yet are still hired. This can be viewed as a ‘front’ women are ‘losing on’ because they believe they need more ‘resources’ in order to win the ‘battle’. Evidently, I think an understanding of this strategy game will be useful in my career, specifically if applied to the current job market. 
Another insight I gained from this week’s workshop was being able to view things through the lens of the cooperation game, prisoners dilemma. One of the video’s we had watched mentioned their application in trade deals and nuclear arms creating. Observing the US/China trade war as a prisoner’s dilemma highlights a political game with no real winners, but the losers being consumers in both countries. Reflecting on all models we have studied so far, it seems applying and testing different models before implementing government policies would be highly beneficial for rewarding outcomes.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I think a personal challenge was establishing the Git extension for Jupyterlab before the deadline on Friday of week 9. While it was a small technical problem, it was crucial for the assignment and a necessary learning curve. Moving forward, I hope to rely on the help of my team members a bit more at times far before the due date in an effort to iron out problems earlier. Despite this, now that it is set up, I believe it will be a useful tool not only in this subject but throughout university, therefore I hope I continue to hone my skills.

## Week 9

### What insights have I gained?

I believe a major insight I have gained from reading the submissions of other groups is the importance of the ‘describe any data sources necessary’ section of the report. I believe as my group completed our own report, I had seen this section as fairly insignificant and only necessary to list the information we will need to find when creating the models. After reviewing other teams’ submissions, I now understand the usefulness of this section to assist planning the inputs and their weighting when models are constructed.  Investigating more into this part of the submission can only result in a greater understanding of how each model works and can provide insight into how the results of each model can come together to suggest more useful conclusions than they may have suggested alone. This is because I anticipate similar inputs into each model will reveal different aspects and require different solutions. Therefore, I hope my team can rework this section, or at least include the observations that result from its research, in the final submission to strengthen our understanding and the overall report.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I think a particular challenge my team encountered was ensuring the report sounded and read like one document, as opposed to multiple sections written by different people. While this was the case during the earlier drafting stages, we overcame the challenge by everyone cross editing each other’s sections and using our group calls to collate our knowledge. I believe this was quite effective and allowed us to learn from each other. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

By the next submission I hope I have furthered my Jupyter and Python skills so that the report is of high quality and I can make the most of this subject. Though I have discussed my expectation that Python will be extremely useful in university and my career previously in this reflection journal, it is becoming more evident to me as I continue with the subject. This is mainly because I am seeing how it can be applied to other aspects of my degree, specifically with statistics, more and more. 

## Week 10:

### What have I learnt this week?

I believe this week set off a deeper understanding of how some of these models work in practise. While prior I had understood that Agent Based Models centred on rules, agents and how the agents performed after the rules were iterated, this still did not translate into code in my mind as I had not had any prior experience with Python. From reading and modifying some Schelling segregation models, I now have a much more complex understanding of how AGM models work. While this is expanding my learning and can be beneficial, I believe I should still be wary of keeping many-model thinking in mind. That is, knowing many models at a base level rather than a small number in great detail, as ‘no models are correct but many models are useful’. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

I believe a specific challenge we encountered this week was segregating tasks between group members appropriately. As I am the only group member with access to our Jupyter Notebook, I foresee it being difficult when we will share codes to push each change to the repository in order to get timely feedback. I think this is a challenge unique to remote learning, as every group member setting up Jupyter to collaborate on the notebook would be difficult to achieve with assistance from teachers only being via online communication. To overcome this, we had agreed on clear and frequent communication between our group, so I am able to update the assignment repository as much as possible. Moreover, making effective and efficient use of our group time is vital. 

A personal challenge I have encountered, as touched on before, is making sure I am not over-complicating the model to be beyond my ability. I think I run the risk of this when examining and modifying codes that are a bit beyond reach, and this may lead to convoluted outcomes that may not be useful when looking at our problem. To counter this, I anticipate I will rely on my group members and ask them if they understand my changes and to double-check my code. Hopefully, if we all agree to do this, we can avoid the risk group-wide.
